A modification for Mindustry, a sandbox tower defense game mixed with elements of resource management and production.

# Folders
[aseprite files] - Sprites that used multiple layers before being converted to usable versions.

[templates] - Various template PNGs for buildings. Feel free to use these for your mods!

[unused content] - Content that has gone unused. Test stuff, Variants of existing content, among other things.

[unused sprites] - Sprites that have gone unused. Variants of existing content, old versions of sprites, that kind of stuff.

bundles - Files that change descriptions and names for different languages.

content - The meat of the mod. Contains the JSON info for everything.

maps - Contains new maps introduced by AeroMindustry.

scripts - JavaScript files that add extra functions to various parts of the game!

sprites - Images to make the mod content look pretty, instead of an indecipherable mess of 'oh no'.

Feel free to use the template files for your own mod!
