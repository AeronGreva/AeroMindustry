A modification for Mindustry, a sandbox tower defense game mixed with elements of resource management and production.

# Folders

[templates] - Various template PNGs for buildings.

bundles - Files that change descriptions and names for different languages.

content - The meat of the mod. Contains the JSON info for everything.

maps - Contains new maps introduced by AeroMindustry.

scripts - JavaScript files that add extra functions to various parts of the game!

sprites - Images to make the mod content look pretty, instead of an indecipherable mess of 'oh no'.

Feel free to use the template files for your own mod!
Also, if you have any ideas you'd like to share with me, just send me a message.
