# AeroMindustry
A modification for Mindustry, a sandbox tower defense game mixed with elements of resource management and production.

# Folders
[aseprite files] - Sprites that used multiple layers before being converted to usable versions.
[templates] - Various template PNGs for buildings. Feel free to use these for your mods!
[unused sprites] - Stuff that has gone unused. Variants of existing content, cut content, that kind of stuff.
content - The meat of the mod. Contains the JSON info for everything.
sprites - Images to make the mod content look pretty, instead of an indecipherable mess of 'oh no'.
