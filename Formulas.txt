Hi. These are just a few handy formulas for figuring out values for various things in the mod.


- Solving for Per-frame Fluid use in machines
	[Desired Amount of Liquid] / craftTime([Desired Craft Period in Seconds] * 60) = Amount of Liquid per Frame

- Conveyor Speed

	[Items per second] / 150 = [speed]

- Solar Generation
	[Desired generation per sec] / 60 = [powerProduction]
